# Sign Language Translation

## Method papers


### Better Sign Language Translation with STMC-Transformer 

* Coling'20 Paper
* Model: STMC-Transformer
* Dataset: HPHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset & ASLG-PC12 corpus
* STMC-Transformer model performing video-to-text translation that surpasses
translation of ground truth glosses, which reveals that glosses are an inefficient representation of sign language.
